## 👩‍💻 About Me
I am currently developing my career path toward **data analytics**, working with Python, SQL, and data visualization tools.  
At the same time, I enjoy learning **web development and web design** as a creative hobby — building websites helps me improve both technical and design skills.

This portfolio was created as part of my learning journey in front-end development.
